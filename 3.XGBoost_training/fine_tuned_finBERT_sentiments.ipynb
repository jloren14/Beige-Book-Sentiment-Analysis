Retailers reported moderate increases in sales, and restaurant sales were also up. Manufacturers\\u2019 results, by contrast, were varied, with half of this round\\u2019s respondents citing declines in sales or revenue or a marked slowdown in the pace of growth. Staffing firms also reported revenue declines, largely attributable to a shortfall of candidates in the current tight labor market. Commercial real estate markets were similar or slightly improved since the last report. Residential real estate markets in most areas saw declines in closed sales and increases in median sales prices. Manufacturers said they were cautious about 2019; other contacts\\u2019 outlooks remained mostly positive. Employment and Wages Business contacts said that labor markets remained tight but wage pressures continued to be moderate. Beyond a shortage of workers in certain skill categories, such as information technology, retail respondents reported no real problems filling job openings. Depending on local labor market conditions, some retailers reported seeing higher wage costs. The restaurant industry complained of severe labor shortages. Hiring by manufacturers was mixed. A furniture maker laid off 10 workers in January. A semiconductor manufacturer facing big declines in demand from China put a hiring freeze in place, but they were reluctant to institute layoffs since it takes three to six months to train new workers. Three-quarters of manufacturing contacts reported continuing to hire at their normal pace; none cited unusual wage pressure. Staffing firms reported tight labor markets and some increases in bill and pay rates (that is, wages). Prices Pricing reports were mixed. Retailers said price declines for certain food categories have slowed down and some grocery categories saw price increases. A prominent big-box retailer reported that some consumer goods manufacturers announced plans to raise prices by 7 percent to 10 percent, though when these cost increases pass through to retail prices depends on when contracts with individual retail chains are renewed. Manufacturing contacts reported no unusual pricing pressures. Retail and Tourism Retailers contacted for this round reported that on a year-over-year basis, comparable-store sales were up by mid-single-digit percentages. Capital spending plans for 2019 are a bit higher than 2018. One contact observed that consumers seem willing to spend on all categories of goods, \\u201cwhether a $10 T-shirt or a $2,000 television set.\\u201d Moderate but positive growth is expected for the rest of this year, though there is some lingering worry that higher tariffs, if implemented, could put a damper on sales of affected products. A contact in the Massachusetts restaurant industry reported that based on meal tax receipts, restaurant sales were up 5.4 percent year-over-year in January. However, these overall results were largely driven by new entrants, as established locations reported sales ranging from flat to down or up 1 percent. Such lackluster performance, higher operating costs, acute labor shortages, and higher labor costs (in part attributable to scheduled increases in the minimum wage for tipped workers) have prompted recent restaurant closings by some experienced and high-profile operators. Given the greater competition from the proliferation of restaurants, operators are reluctant to raise menu prices to cover their higher costs. Despite the threat of more closings, aggregate expectations for the Massachusetts restaurant industry in 2019 are positive. Manufacturing and Related Services The news from manufacturers was mixed. Of eight responding firms, two reported substantial drops in sales and two reported significant weakness. The two firms that reported serious issues were a semiconductor manufacturer and a furniture builder. The furniture firm makes its products in factories in New England; they reported sales in January were down 30 percent versus the same period a year earlier; but better results over President\\u2019s Day weekend reduced concern. The semiconductor firm sells mostly to the auto industry and said that a 40 percent drop in new orders from China was the biggest fall in sales since the collapse of Lehman in 2008. Two other firms, both with heavy exposure to semiconductors, said that the market had slowed significantly since earlier in 2018. Four other contacts reported good overall sales. Capital expenditures were down for several contacts and unchanged for others. One said that they had \\u201cmothballed\\u201d plans for a major expansion of a semiconductor wafer plant; another said they might delay construction of a new plant due to start this summer. Most manufacturing contacts expressed caution about 2019. The ones facing the most severe declines were waiting to see if the weakness was transitory, while others said they were very uncertain. The slowdown in China, whether or not the result of trade issues, cast a shadow over the manufacturing sector. Staffing Services New England staffing firms reported negative single-digit revenue growth for the year 2018. Regardless of industry and placement type, all respondents cited low unemployment rates and limited applicant supply as challenges to their business, and remarked on the healthy number of job requests from clients. A few staffing firms said the tight labor market made it possible to raise rates, with no push-back from clients. Most firms reported ongoing work to strengthen relationships with community groups and advertise for candidates on social media channels. The partial government shutdown reportedly created uncertainty among client organizations, who were less willing to make hiring decisions near the end of 2018. Under tight labor market conditions and with a limited talent pool, respondents expressed mixed views on the outlook, but a majority were optimistic. Commercial Real Estate Commercial real estate fundamentals in the First District were either flat or up slightly in recent weeks, depending on the location and property type. Office leasing activity remained strong in both Boston and Portland, with asking rents continuing to rise in the former and holding steady in the latter. Office leasing was described as stable at a modest pace in Providence and slow (but also stable) in Hartford. In Providence, office rents were up 2 percent to 4 percent from one year ago; in Hartford, rents have been flat for an extended period. Industrial leasing demand was robust in most of the First District, although low inventories held back activity in Rhode Island. Contacts in Providence and Hartford perceived that investors were increasingly seeking to purchase properties in smaller cities in order to obtain higher yields than in Boston, but hard numbers on transactions volume were not available. Planned construction of speculative office space tailored to the life sciences industry increased in the Boston area. Commercial real estate lenders were reported to be offering increasingly narrow interest rate spreads and generous loan terms. Construction costs continued to rise on average, and one Boston contact saw steep increases in subcontracting costs from a year ago that were attributed to scarce labor in the skilled trades. Most contacts maintained a positive outlook. However, some expect economic growth--and hence demand for commercial real estate--to slow in 2019. Residential Real Estate Heading into 2019, residential real estate markets in the First District experienced a slowdown in sales. Sales decreased or stayed flat in all reporting areas for both single family homes and condos. (Most areas reported year-over-year changes from December 2017 to December 2018, while New Hampshire reported statistics through January 2019.) Contacts cited interest rate hikes, appreciating prices, and the recent partial government shut down as possible reasons for lower sales. For single family homes, median sales prices increased in all reporting areas but Massachusetts. Inventory dropped in all areas except Rhode Island. For condos, prices declined in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, stayed flat in Boston, and increased slightly in Maine. Condo inventory increased in most areas, while New Hampshire saw a moderate drop. Vermont data refer to single family homes and condos combined; the median sales price increased, while inventories declined.

Contacted retailers, manufacturers, and software and IT services providers, while still reporting mixed results, are more confident about their companies' and the economy's eventual recovery. Staffing firms cite upticks in activity. Residential real estate sales rose in recent months, although prices continued to fall; commercial real estate markets remain very soft. Price pressures are mostly said to be modest and fewer firms say they plan layoffs than in the last round. Retail Contacted retailers in the First District report mixed sales results for the months of July and August. Several retailers attribute soft sales in part to inclement weather, while others note that consumers still seem to be cautious in their spending and focused on getting the best value for their dollar; some respondents feel this trend is going to be the \\\"new norm\\\" and that recovery will be a long and drawn out process. However, other respondents see signs of improvement, particularly in sales of items classified as discretionary, and many First District retail contacts are more optimistic than in recent conversations. Retailers continue to manage inventory levels carefully, with several working to bring inventory more in line with sales. Capital spending remains carefully controlled. Contacts note that headcounts are stable. Selling prices are steady, but a few retailers express concern about potential price pressures. Manufacturing and Related Services Most manufacturing and related services contacts headquartered in the First District report that the pace of business has improved or exceeded expectations in recent months. Some contacts had higher sales in the second quarter than in the first and anticipate further growth in the third quarter. Several others indicate that their sales picked up slightly starting in the summer. Among the few respondents who report continued worsening in sales trends, one is hoping to see improvement as consumers broaden their spending increases beyond automobiles and electronic equipment. Despite the recent upticks, however, almost all manufacturing and related services respondents note that sales and orders have remained well below year-earlier levels. Some companies have temporarily shut factories in order to hold down inventories. Only the biopharmaceutical sector reports sustained sales growth during the past year. Manufacturers say that materials costs are flat to down compared to a year ago. The only notable increases are due to foreign currency appreciation. Selling prices also are reported to be mostly flat to down, depending on the degree of market competition. Apart from implementing previously announced restructuring programs, most of the contacted manufacturers and related services providers have no plans to increase or decrease their U.S. employment in coming months. Domestic hiring is limited mostly to offsetting attrition or expanding R&D and finance staffing. Many firms are continuing to hold down labor costs through furloughs, pay freezes, or suspensions of 401K plan matches. Several respondents that had cut employee pay 5 percent to 20 percent earlier this year say they are now planning to restore previous pay levels in 2010. Capital spending plans remain subdued, and center mostly on new product development or cost reduction. Most manufacturers and related services providers are planning for modest revenue growth and continued cost controls over the coming six to 12 months. Many indicate that their finances are in solid shape, with stable or improving cash flow. Some express lingering concerns about consumer spending. Software and Information Technology Services New England software and information technology firms report mixed results, with some experiencing continued slowdowns while others have begun to see modest improvement. Nevertheless, revenue changes from a year ago are largely in the range from zero to minus 15 percent. Contacts report continued interest from prospective clients but a hesitancy to commit due to budget uncertainties and a general lack of confidence. One respondent notes decreased maintenance revenues, as many clients have laid off employees and consequently have reduced maintenance needs. Most First District software and IT firms report managing expenses very closely to maintain profitability, through personnel reductions, salary freezes, the use of video conferencing instead of physical travel, and decreased spending on marketing. Meanwhile, other firms continue to invest in their workforces and in R&D, hoping to benefit when the recovery does occur. Selling prices are being maintained. Several New England software and IT services contacts report that positive signs they see in the economy are not yet reflected in their numbers; most respondents anticipate a long recovery and expect only modest growth in 2010. Staffing Services Nearly all New England staffing contacts report upticks in labor demand in recent weeks, but they are uncertain whether the increased demand will be sustained; yearly revenues generally show declines in the 10 percent to 40 percent range. Contacts report growth or its initial signs in the manufacturing and financial industries as well as in the information technology, pharmaceutical, and retail sectors. However, the increase in demand applies only to temporary labor, as placements for direct hires remain minimal; indeed, one contact does not anticipate demand for permanent labor to return until 2011. While there are plenty of job seekers, labor supply is still low for specialized positions. Staffing contacts express continued concern over expected increases in health insurance costs and state unemployment taxes in 2010 and whether they will able to pass those costs on to clients who may not yet be profitable. Contacts note that clients are currently hiring to fill vacancies, rather than hiring to expand. One contact indicates that many companies are trying to do their own sourcing instead of utilizing staffing firms, as hiring speed is no longer paramount. New England temporary services respondents are largely more optimistic than they were three and six months ago, but remain uncertain about the near term, as they anticipate a long, gradual recovery. Commercial Real Estate Commercial real estate contacts report no major changes in market conditions since last time. Leasing volume remains very low and downward pressure on rents continues to be intense across the region. Vacancy rates have not increased perceptibly since the last report, but net absorption is perceived to be negative. Landlords are reportedly trying to hang on to existing tenants \\\"at all costs.\\\" A large supply of sublease space is augmented by \\\"shadow space\\\" that many firms are not using but which they cannot readily sublet. Very little construction activity is in progress in the region: Speculative office construction is basically non-existent, but small condo conversion projects are under way in Cambridge and Boston. In recent weeks, our Providence contact has seen an increase in foreclosure sales of commercial properties, all of which had been originally financed through commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). Sale prices on these properties reflect discounts of up to 60 percent from peak prices observed in 2007. A Boston contact has observed declines in property value ranging from 30 percent to 60 percent on various downtown office buildings. One contact predicts that the national commercial property value index will decline 50 percent peak-to-trough before recovering. In a number of cases, rents have fallen below the level that supports debt repayment. In light of these conditions, delinquencies and foreclosures are expected to increase further in the coming months. Underwriting standards in the commercial market remain very strict, with loan-to-value ratios largely below 70 percent. Small regional banks continue to support the bulk of financing activity in the region. Our regional banking contact reports that they have maintained a healthy balance sheet through conservative lending, and experienced higher profits this summer compared to a year ago as a result of increased market share in (commercial and residential) mortgage lending. Over the next six months, contacts expect commercial market fundamentals either to decline further (in Boston and Providence) or to remain roughly flat (in Hartford). None expects a significant recovery of property values within the next year, and possibly longer depending on the extent of commercial foreclosures and the employment outlook. The recovery of deal volume, rental rates, and vacancy rates typically lag recovery in employment rates by up to six months. Therefore, contacts are watching the employment numbers closely and adjusting their forecasts accordingly. Residential Real Estate Residential real estate markets in New England showed some positive signs in June and July. All contacts report increasing year-over-year sales in either June or July, many for the first time in 2009. Home sales increased between 4 percent and 13 percent year-over-year across the region. Condos in Massachusetts also showed a small year-over-year sales increase in July. Most of the sales activity is said to be taking place at the low end of the market, partly because the first-time homebuyer tax credit has been successful in spurring activity for entry-level homes. The high end of the market, including second homes, is still very quiet. A New Hampshire contact reports that distressed properties, including bank-owned properties, are moving, although the sales process for these homes is complicated and the deals often fall through. Contacts say that although the June and July results are promising, they will not be confident that they have passed the bottom until sales increase for another month or two. While sales were up, New England home prices continued to fall in June and July. Median home prices fell 5 percent to 14 percent year-over-year in July in the six states. An exception was the Boston area, where the median home price in July was only about 1 percent below what it was in July 2008. This Boston contact believes that sellers are pricing more realistically and \\\"further price declines should be minimal.\\\" Another contact attributes low prices to the large number of bank-owned property sales and also to the fact that prices at the peak were unsustainable; this contact does not believe that prices will return quickly to the pre-slump level. Respondents report the inventory of homes for sale in Massachusetts has fallen below a \\\"balanced\\\" market level, as potential sellers are listing their homes \\\"only if they have to;\\\" this seeming shortage should self-correct once prices stabilize.\",\n          \"  Beige Book Report: St Louis February 29, 2012 Economic activity in the Eighth District has continued to expand at a modest   pace since the previous survey. Manufacturing activity has continued to   increase, and activity in the services sector has also increased. Residential   real estate activity has continued to decline, while commercial real estate   market conditions have been mixed. Overall lending at a sample of large District   banks saw little change during the fourth quarter of 2011. Consumer Spending Contacts reported that retail sales in   January and early February were up slightly, on average, over year-earlier   levels. Half of the retailers saw increases in sales, while 37 percent saw   decreases and 13 percent saw no changes. Roughly 71 percent of the retailers   reported that sales levels met their expectations, 17 percent reported that   sales were below expectations, and 12 percent reported that sales were above   expectations. About 21 percent of the retailers reported that their inventories   were too high, while 12 percent reported that their inventories were too low.   The sales outlook for March and April was mostly optimistic: 65 percent of the   retailers expect sales to increase over 2011 levels, while 13 percent expect   sales to decrease and 22 percent expect sales to be similar to last year's   sales. Car dealers in the District reported that sales in January and early February   were up slightly, on average, compared with last year's sales. About 48 percent   of the car dealers surveyed saw increases in sales, while 32 percent saw   decreases and 20 percent saw no changes. Twenty-eight percent of the car dealers   reported that used car sales had increased relative to new car sales, while 24   percent reported the opposite. Thirty-two percent of contacts reported an   increase in sales of low-end vehicles relative to high-end vehicles, while 8   percent reported the opposite. Thirty-two percent of the car dealers surveyed   reported that their inventories were too low, while 24 percent reported that   their inventories were too high. The sales outlook for March and April was   mostly optimistic: 76 percent of the car dealers expect sales to increase over   2011 levels, while just 4 percent expect sales to decrease and 20 percent expect   sales to be similar to last year's sales. Manufacturing and Other Business Activity Manufacturing   activity has continued to increase since our previous report. Several   manufacturers reported plans to open plants and expand operations in the near   future, while a smaller number of contacts reported plans to close plants or   decrease operations. Firms in the furniture, automobile, food, stone product,   air conditioning component, and medical device manufacturing industries   announced plans to increase existing operations and hire new workers.   Additionally, firms in the automobile parts and primary metal manufacturing   industries announced plans to open new plants and hire workers. In contrast,   firms in the faucet, chemical, paper product, and lawn mower manufacturing   industries announced plans to close plants and lay off workers. Activity in the District's services sector has continued to increase since   our previous report. Firms in information technology services, pest control   services, distribution services, health services, and leisure services announced   plans to expand operations and hire new workers. In contrast, contacts in   freight transportation services, education services, government services, and   business support services announced plans to decrease operations and lay off   workers. Real Estate and Construction Home sales continued to   decline throughout most of the Eighth District. Compared with 2010, total 2011   home sales were down 2 percent in Memphis, 3 percent in St. Louis, 4 percent in   Louisville, and 6 percent in Little Rock. Residential construction also   continued to decrease throughout the District. Total 2011 single-family housing   permits decreased in the majority of the District metro areas compared with   2010. Permits decreased 15 percent in Louisville, 20 percent in Little Rock, and   21 percent in St. Louis. However, permits increased 1 percent in Memphis. Commercial and industrial real estate conditions were mixed throughout the   Eighth District. Contacts in Memphis reported weak commercial real estate loan   demand but stable industrial real estate activity. Contacts in Louisville   reported that commercial real estate activity has increased since December 2011   while contacts in St. Louis noted an increase in fourth-quarter 2011 office and   industrial vacancy rates compared with the third quarter of 2011. Commercial and   industrial construction also varied throughout the District. Contacts in south   central Kentucky noted that commercial construction is showing improved activity   with recent business additions and relocations in the region. Contacts in   western Kentucky, however, noted that construction projects are very scarce,   with the exception of Owensboro-Daviess County, which has a significant number   of public and private projects underway. Contacts in northwest Arkansas noted an   increase in commercial building construction in the Bentonville area, while   contacts in Little Rock continued to report overall weak construction   activity. Banking and Finance A survey of senior loan officers at a   sample of large District banks showed little change in overall lending activity   during the fourth quarter of 2011. During this period, credit standards and   demand for commercial and industrial loans remained unchanged. Credit standards   for commercial real estate loans also remained unchanged. Demand for these loans   ranged from unchanged to moderately stronger. Meanwhile, credit standards for   consumer loans remained unchanged, while demand ranged from moderately weaker to   about the same. Credit standards for prime residential mortgage loans ranged   from unchanged to somewhat eased, while demand for these loans ranged from about   the same to moderately stronger. Agriculture and Natural Resources Yields for corn,   sorghum, hay, soybeans, and cotton were lower in 2011 compared with 2010, while   yields for winter wheat, rice, and tobacco showed positive gains. Monthly output   of commercial red meat for December 2011 decreased compared with November 2011;   the District's total live weight and number of chickens slaughtered also   decreased during the same period. The District's coal production for January   2012 was 1 percent lower compared with January 2011. Similarly, as of early   February, year-to-date coal production was 4.2 percent lower than the same   period in 2011.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tone\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.23081939992207914,\n        \"min\": -0.6808510638297872,\n        \"max\": 0.7380952380952381,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1337,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0535714285714285,\n          0.1566265060240964,\n          0.296875\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
